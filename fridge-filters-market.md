<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fridge Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) Filters</li><li>Carbon Block Filters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fridge filters market comprises two main types: Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) filters and Carbon Block filters. GAC filters use loose granules of activated carbon to adsorb impurities, providing effective filtration but with a shorter lifespan and lower contaminant reduction capabilities. In contrast, Carbon Block filters consist of tightly compressed activated carbon, offering superior contaminant removal and a longer lifespan due to their larger surface area and more efficient adsorption. Both types enhance the quality of drinking water from refrigerators.</p></p>
