<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The C1GLT Antibody Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>pAbs</li><li>mAb</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The C1GLT antibody market comprises two primary types: polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). pAbs are generated from multiple immune cells and target various epitopes, resulting in a broad range of binding capabilities but with variability in specificity. In contrast, mAbs are produced from a single clone of B cells, providing high specificity and consistency, making them ideal for diagnostics and therapeutic applications. Both types serve critical roles in research, diagnostic, and treatment settings.</p></p>
