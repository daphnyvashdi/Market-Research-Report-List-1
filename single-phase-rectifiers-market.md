<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single-phase Rectifiers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Half-wave Rectification</li><li>Full-wave Rectification</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The single-phase rectifiers market is segmented into two main types: half-wave and full-wave rectification. Half-wave rectifiers allow current to flow only during one half of the input cycle, resulting in lower efficiency and higher ripple voltage. Conversely, full-wave rectifiers convert both halves of the input cycle into a usable output, offering higher efficiency, lower ripple, and improved voltage regulation. The choice between these types often depends on application requirements and cost considerations within industries utilizing power supply systems.</p></p>
