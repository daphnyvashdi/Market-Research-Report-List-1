<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Mercury Analyzers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption</li><li>Cold Atomic Fluorescence</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Industrial Mercury Analyzers market is primarily categorized into two types: Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption (CVAA) and Cold Atomic Fluorescence (CAF). CVAA utilizes a technique where mercury vapor is generated from a sample and then quantified by measuring the absorption of light, suitable for high sensitivity. On the other hand, CAF employs a method where mercury in a sample emits fluorescent light after excitation, allowing for precise detection even in low concentrations. Both techniques are crucial for environmental monitoring and regulatory compliance.</p></p>
