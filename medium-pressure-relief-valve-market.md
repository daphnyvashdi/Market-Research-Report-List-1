<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medium Pressure Relief Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring-Type</li><li>Lever-Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Medium Pressure Relief Valve market features primarily two types: Spring-Type and Lever-Type. Spring-Type valves use a preloaded spring mechanism to regulate pressure by opening at a predetermined set point to release excess pressure, ensuring safe operation. Lever-Type valves, on the other hand, utilize a lever arm that opens a valve seat as pressure builds, enabling controlled release through mechanical advantage. Both types are essential in industrial applications for safeguarding equipment from overpressure conditions, ensuring reliability and safety.</p></p>
