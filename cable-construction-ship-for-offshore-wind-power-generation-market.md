<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cable Construction Ship for Offshore Wind Power Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-propulsion</li><li>Non-self-flight</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The offshore wind power generation market utilizes two main types of cable construction ships: self-propulsion and non-self-propulsion vessels. Self-propulsion ships are equipped with their own engines, allowing them to navigate autonomously to various offshore sites for cable laying and maintenance. In contrast, non-self-propulsion vessels require external tugboats for movement and positioning, often relying on towing or dynamic positioning systems. Both types are essential for efficiently connecting wind farms to the grid and facilitating cable installation in challenging marine environments.</p></p>
