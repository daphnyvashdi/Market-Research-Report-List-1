<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Swage Nipples Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concentric</li><li>Eccentric</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Swage nipples are pipe fittings used to connect pipes of different diameters. The market can be categorized into two main types: concentric and eccentric swage nipples. Concentric swage nipples have a symmetrical design, allowing for equal flow and pressure distribution; they are typically used in vertical applications. Eccentric swage nipples, on the other hand, feature an offset design, facilitating drainage and reducing air pockets in horizontal piping systems. Both types cater to varying installation requirements and flow characteristics in piping systems.</p></p>
